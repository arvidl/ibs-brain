**ABSTRACT** (in prep.)

_Background_. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition within the spectrum of gut-brain disorders, characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, altered bowel habits, and different patterns of psychological distress. While brain-gut interactions are increasingly recognized in IBS pathophysiology, the relationship between brain morphometry, cognitive function, and clinical presentation remains poorly understood.<br> 
_Objectives_. (i) To replicate previous univariate morphometric findings in patients with IBS and conduct software comparisons; (2) to investigate whether multivariate analysis of brain morphometric measures and cognitive test performance can distinguish patients with IBS from healthy controls (HCs), and to evaluate the relative importance of structural and cognitive features in this discrimination.   <br>
_Methods_. In this cross-sectional study, 49 patients with IBS and 29 HCs underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain examination and completed the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Brain morphometry was analyzed using two versions of FreeSurfer software (v6.0.1 and v7.4.1). IBS severity was assessed using the IBS-Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS). We employed univariate and multivariate statistical and machine learning approaches, including cross-validation, to analyze morphometric and cognitive measures. <br> 
_Results_. A systematic comparison of the FreeSurfer versions revealed substantial variations in morphometric measurements. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed limited discrimination between IBS and HC groups using morphometric measures alone. However, when combining morphometric and cognitive measures in a machine learning framework, the model achieved 93\% sensitivity in identifying IBS patients, albeit with 22\% specificity. Feature importance analysis highlighted the significance of subcortical structures (particularly hippocampus, caudate, and putamen) and two cognitive domains (recall and verbal skills) in group discrimination. Software version comparison revealed a substantial impact on morphometric measurements. <br>
_Discussion_. Contributing with a comprehensive open-source framework for data analysis, assessment of cross-cohort consistency, and machine learning, our findings suggest that combining brain morphometry and cognitive measures provides better discrimination between IBS and HC groups than either measure alone. The identified importance of subcortical structures and specific cognitive domains supports a complex brain-gut interaction in IBS. These results emphasize the need for multimodal approaches in IBS research and careful consideration of methodological factors in brain morphometry studies. \, GitHub code and data: \small{\url{https://github.com/arvidl/ibs-brain}}}
